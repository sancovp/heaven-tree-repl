# Future Implementations

This directory contains specifications for features that will be implemented in later phases of the HEAVEN Tree REPL development roadmap.

## Game Mechanics (Phase 4)

These comprehensive game mechanics specifications will be implemented after the core agent integration system is complete:

- **CRYSTAL_FOREST_BUSINESS_GAME.md**: 3-phase progression system (Character → Business → Infinite Game)
- **XP_ACHIEVEMENT_SYSTEM.md**: Experience points and achievement tracking
- **ZONE_BASED_PROGRESSION.md**: Skill-based progression through development zones
- **WORKFLOW_STATUS_AND_MODES.md**: Workflow approval and execution modes

## Implementation Timeline

These features are planned for **Phase 4** of the development roadmap, after:

1. ✅ **Phase 1**: Prompt Engineering Agent Prototype (Current)
2. **Phase 2**: General Adaptor Layer
3. **Phase 3**: Universal Agent App Generator
4. **Phase 4**: Game Mechanics Integration (← These specs)

## Design Philosophy

The game mechanics are designed to:
- Provide motivation and progress tracking for users
- Gamify the workflow development process
- Support both individual and business-level progression
- Create engaging feedback loops for skill development

These specifications will be revisited and potentially refined during Phase 4 implementation based on learnings from the earlier phases.
