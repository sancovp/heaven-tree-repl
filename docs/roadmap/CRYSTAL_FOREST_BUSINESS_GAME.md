# Crystal Forest Business Game Implementation Plan

## Original Design Insights

### Key Quotes from Design Session

**On Self-Guiding Systems:**
> "so im thinking it goes from Novice to Grandmaster and it is based on something we can calculate about your programmatic potential vs what is reified in the treerepl / profit generated"

**On Business as MMO Character:**
> "so you reach max level when you have all the talents required to make profit. if we think about an MMO, profit means you are now a business, so if we think about business like a character with equipment slots, and the business process ontology are the equipment slot types..."

**On Equipment Slot Emergence:**
> "right then once you generate profit its about an infinite game of getting better equipment. but you have to use the system to generate some emergence where you have a business from it...thats how you get your equipment slots"

**On Mathematical Space Translation:**
> "and since we can think of mathematical spaces as having equipment, it's very easy to translate this, since everything here is a graph being rendered as a tree when it poses (its a superposition)"

**On Simple Implementation:**
> "ok cool so thats very easy to implement actually. when you make profit, your system becomes a Business with EquipmentSlots which are all the workflows in your core crystal layer that makes you money. As you add more revenue streams you get more equipment slots, and that is leveling up your Business...and that's the endgame. So the point is to go from Novice to Grandmaster and open a Business..."

## Core Concept
The Groundhog Day Crystal Forest Game evolves from character progression to business ownership through workflow crystallization and profit generation. The system is **self-guiding** because progression is based on reifying programmatic potential into actual profit-generating workflows.

## Three-Phase System

### Phase 1: Character Progression (Novice → Grandmaster)
**Objective**: Learn to crystallize workflows and generate consistent profit

**Progression Levels**:
- **Novice** (0-5% reification): Vast potential, almost nothing crystallized
- **Apprentice** (5-15%): Beginning to crystallize basic patterns  
- **Journeyman** (15-30%): Solid foundation of golden workflows
- **Expert** (30-50%): Half of potential is actively generating value
- **Master** (50-75%): Most potential is reified, system largely self-sustaining
- **Grandmaster** (75-95%): Near-complete reification, ready for business

**Reification Ratio Formula**:
```
Reification Ratio = (Total Profit Generated) / (Programmatic Potential)

where:
- Total Profit Generated = Sum of all value from golden workflows
- Programmatic Potential = Theoretical max value from current tree structure
```

**Progression Mechanics**:
- Execute workflows → gain experience points
- Successful workflows → crystallize into golden status
- Golden workflows → generate consistent profit
- Higher reification ratio → advance to next level

### Phase 2: Business Ascension (Grandmaster → Business Owner)
**Trigger**: When `total_profit >= sustainability_threshold` (e.g., $1000+ recurring monthly)

**Class Evolution**:
- Player character transforms into Business entity
- All profit-generating golden workflows become **Equipment Slots**
- Each unique revenue stream creates a new equipment slot
- Equipment slot names emerge from actual workflow functions

**Example Equipment Slot Discovery**:
```python
# Golden workflows that generate profit:
workflows = [
    "customer_acquisition_funnel",    # → Equipment Slot: "Customer Acquisition"
    "product_delivery_automation",    # → Equipment Slot: "Product Delivery" 
    "billing_and_collection",         # → Equipment Slot: "Revenue Collection"
    "customer_support_system"         # → Equipment Slot: "Customer Retention"
]
```

### Phase 3: Infinite Game (Business Optimization)
**Objective**: Endless optimization and expansion of the business

**Equipment Slot Mechanics**:
- **Upgrade Equipment**: Improve workflows in existing slots (better efficiency, higher profit)
- **Add Revenue Streams**: Create new equipment slots through new profit-generating workflows
- **Scale Operations**: Increase volume/capacity of existing equipment slots
- **Cross-Slot Synergy**: Discover workflow combinations that enhance multiple slots

**Business Leveling**:
- Business Level = Number of active equipment slots
- Higher level businesses can handle more complex operations
- Advanced businesses unlock meta-workflows (workflows that manage other workflows)

## Data Structures

### Phase 1: Character
```python
@dataclass
class Player:
    # Identity
    player_id: str
    character_name: str
    
    # Progression
    level: PlayerLevel  # Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, Master, Grandmaster
    experience_points: int
    reification_ratio: float
    
    # Performance Metrics
    total_profit_generated: float
    golden_workflows: List[GoldenWorkflow]
    programmatic_potential: float  # Calculated from tree structure
    
    # Session Persistence (survives Groundhog Day)
    session_count: int
    created_at: datetime
    last_session: datetime
    achievements: List[Achievement]
```

### Phase 2: Business Evolution
```python
@dataclass
class Business(Player):  # Inherits all player attributes
    # Business Identity
    business_name: str
    business_type: str  # Emergent from equipment slots
    
    # Equipment System
    equipment_slots: Dict[str, GoldenWorkflow]  # Slot name -> Workflow
    revenue_streams: List[RevenueStream]
    monthly_recurring_profit: float
    
    # Business Metrics
    business_level: int  # Number of equipment slots
    sustainability_score: float  # Profit stability over time
    growth_rate: float  # Month-over-month improvement
    
    # Advanced Features
    meta_workflows: List[Workflow]  # Workflows that manage other workflows

```

### Supporting Structures
```python
@dataclass
class GoldenWorkflow:
    name: str
    coordinate: str
    profit_per_execution: float
    success_rate: float  # Must be >95% for Golden status
    execution_count: int  # Must be >10 for Golden status

## Integration with Tree Shell

### Hooks into Existing RSI System
1. **After workflow execution** (`_execute_action`) → Update player stats, check for Golden status
2. **During pattern analysis** (`_handle_analyze_patterns`) → Calculate reification ratio
3. **On pathway crystallization** (`_handle_crystallize_pattern`) → Award progression XP
4. **Main menu display** → Inject game status and business briefing

### New Methods to Add
```python
class TreeShell:
    def load_player_progress(self) -> Union[Player, Business]:
        # Load from ~/.tree_repl/player_progress.json
        
    def save_player_progress(self):
        # Persist player/business state
        
    def calculate_reification_ratio(self) -> float:
        # (Total Profit Generated) / (Programmatic Potential)
        
    def check_business_ascension(self) -> bool:
        # Check if player qualifies for business upgrade
        
    def upgrade_to_business(self) -> Business:
        # Transform player into business, create equipment slots
        
    def generate_game_briefing(self) -> str:
        # Create templated main menu with current status
```
