# HEAVEN Tree REPL Development Roadmap

## Overview

The HEAVEN Tree REPL development follows a phased approach, starting with concrete agent implementations and progressively abstracting to create a universal system for generating any HEAVEN agent tree repl app.

## Phase 1: Prompt Engineering Agent Prototype (CURRENT)
**Goal**: Create a working prompt engineering agent heaven tree repl app

### Objectives:
- Build a concrete prompt engineering agent using HEAVEN framework
- Integrate the agent with TreeShell navigation system
- Validate the agent ↔ TreeShell integration pattern
- Create working prototype to inform abstraction layer design

### Deliverables:
- Prompt engineering agent tree repl app
- Integration patterns documentation
- Lessons learned for general adaptor design

### Success Criteria:
- Functional prompt engineering workflows in tree navigation
- Agent can create, edit, and manage prompts through tree interface
- Clear understanding of integration requirements

## Phase 2: General Adaptor Layer
**Goal**: Abstract the integration between HEAVEN agents and TreeShell

### Objectives:
- Extract common patterns from prompt engineering agent integration
- Design adaptor interfaces for agent ↔ TreeShell communication
- Create reusable components for any agent type
- Build configuration-driven integration system

### Deliverables:
- Agent-TreeShell adaptor framework
- Configuration schemas for different agent types
- Integration utilities and helpers
- Documentation for adaptor usage

### Success Criteria:
- Any HEAVEN agent can be integrated via configuration
- Consistent navigation patterns across agent types
- Minimal code duplication between agent integrations

## Phase 3: Universal Agent App Generator
**Goal**: Generate any HEAVEN agent tree repl app using the adaptor system

### Objectives:
- Build generator that creates tree repl apps from agent configs
- Support multiple agent types (coder, researcher, etc.)
- Provide templates and scaffolding for common patterns
- Enable rapid deployment of new agent applications

### Deliverables:
- Universal agent app generator
- Agent configuration templates
- Generated app deployment system
- Multi-agent orchestration capabilities

### Success Criteria:
- Generate coder agent tree repl app from config
- Support for complex multi-agent workflows
- Easy deployment and distribution of generated apps

## Phase 4: Game Mechanics Integration
**Goal**: Add gamification layer to agent applications

### Objectives:
- Implement game mechanics from roadmap specifications:
  - Crystal Forest Business Game progression
  - XP and Achievement System
  - Zone-Based Progression
  - Workflow Status and Modes
- Integrate game mechanics into prompt engineering agent
- Abstract game mechanics for use across all agent types
- Create gamified versions of existing applications

### Deliverables:
- Game mechanics implementation in base TreeShell
- Gamified prompt engineering agent
- Game mechanics configuration system
- Player progression persistence

### Success Criteria:
- Working game progression in prompt engineering agent
- Reusable game mechanics across agent types
- Engaging user experience with clear advancement

## Phase 5: Enhanced Base Library
**Goal**: Integrate all improvements back into heaven-tree-repl package

### Objectives:
- Add universal generator to core package
- Include game mechanics as optional components
- Provide comprehensive agent integration toolkit
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Deliverables:
- Enhanced heaven-tree-repl v0.2.0
- Agent integration toolkit
- Comprehensive documentation
- Migration guides for existing users

### Success Criteria:
- Users can generate any agent tree repl app
- Game mechanics available as opt-in feature
- Smooth upgrade path from v0.1.0

## Phase 6: Advanced Integrations (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Add advanced HEAVEN framework capabilities

### Planned Components:
- **MCP System Integration**: Model Context Protocol support
- **Full HEAVEN Framework**: Complete integration with HEAVEN ecosystem
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Complex agent interaction patterns
- **Business Intelligence**: Analytics and optimization features

### Success Criteria:
- Full HEAVEN ecosystem compatibility
- Enterprise-ready features
- Scalable multi-agent deployments

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Prompt Engineering Agent Prototype

### Next Steps:
1. Design prompt engineering agent tree repl application
2. Implement agent-TreeShell integration
3. Create working prototype with core prompt engineering workflows
4. Document integration patterns for Phase 2 abstraction

### Technical Priorities:
- Agent configuration and initialization
- Tree navigation for prompt management
- Workflow execution integration
- State persistence and session management
